### Hot to build ###

2D.js is build with Grunt. If you don't already have this, go install Node and NPM then install the Grunt Command Line.

```
$> npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then, in the folder where you have downloaded the source, install the build dependencies using npm:

```
$> npm install
```

Then build:

```
$> grunt
```

This will create a minified version at bin/2D.js and a non-minified version at bin/2D.dev.js.
It also copies the non-minified version to the examples.

### Current Features ###

Will be soon...

### Usage ###
